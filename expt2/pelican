<h1 style="color: blue;" text-align="center">PELICAN</h1>
<p>
    Pelicans (genus Pelecanus) are a genus of large water birds that make up the family Pelecanidae. 
    They are characterized by a long beak and a large throat pouch used for catching prey and draining water from the scooped-up contents before swallowing. 
    They have predominantly pale plumage, except for the brown and Peruvian pelicans.
     The bills, pouches, and bare facial skin of all pelicans become brightly coloured before the breeding season. 
     The eight living pelican species have a patchy global distribution, ranging latitudinally from the tropics to the temperate zone, though they are absent from interior South America and from polar regions and the open ocean.
